## W03 Group Project Proposal
### Project Title : Family Budget & Expense Tracker

### Project Overview

The Family Budget & Expense Tracker is a web-based application designed to help individuals and families manage their personal finances more effectively. Many households struggle to keep track of expenses, stay within a budget, and understand where their money is being spent each month. This application provides a simple, structured way to record expenses, categorize spending, and view monthly summaries.

The application will allow users to create an account, log in securely, and manage their own financial data. Users can add, edit, and delete expenses, assign them to categories, and view summarized reports of their spending. Visual feedback such as charts and totals will help users quickly understand their financial habits and make informed decisions.

This project is valuable because it solves a real-world problem that affects many people. It also provides strong learning opportunities for the team by incorporating core .NET concepts such as MVC/Blazor architecture, database interaction, user authentication, and CRUD operations. The scope is realistic for a semester-long group project while still being meaningful and portfolio-worthy.

### Problem Statement & Target Users
